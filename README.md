# LET-MEOWT

Let-Meowt is a point-and-click escape-room style game built in unity.The player is a cat trying
to escape from various rooms. There are 3 levels planned with a single solution to each one.
Players are free to explore each room as they search for their escape.

In the world of gaming, there are cat-themed games and escape room games. There is not,
however, a pixel art, cat-themed escape room game. That is where Let ME-OWT comes in.
Let ME-OWT offers the charming visuals of pixel art and cats and hilarious cat-based escape
room puzzles. Knock everything off counters and tables to find potential tools. Jump around
and explore places you shouldnâ€™t. Think like a cat and escape like one too.
